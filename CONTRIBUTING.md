# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing. This repository contains a small, self-contained Python script. Contributions that expand the project in useful ways are welcome. Examples:

- Add unit tests for the geometry functions.
- Add plotting or visualisation for the grid search results.
- Replace the simple analytic CP model with higher-fidelity approximations or data-driven validation.

Recommended workflow

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/your-feature`.
3. Make your changes and add tests where appropriate.
4. Run the test suite (if present) and ensure linting passes.
5. Push and open a pull request describing your changes.

Please ensure your contributions include clear descriptions and, when applicable, tests or small examples demonstrating the change.
